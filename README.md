## filter
API for digital signal processing in C#. Developed in the context of a project thesis at TU Graz.

### Features
#### Algorithms
- standard vector operations (addition, multiplication...)
- special vector operations (shift...)
- window synthesis (Hann, Blackman...)
- some mathematical functions (root finding, modified bessel function)
- fast fourier transform, using fftw as backend
- fast convolution, cross correlation
- evaluation of coefficient-based zero/pole filters
- synthesis of standard signals
- signal interpolation
- signal analysis (group delay...)

#### signal / filter model
Provides an object-oriented programming model for signals and filters.
